are very appreciative of the work done by translators and proofreaders!

## Become a proofreader

> **Note:** Before requesting Proofreader permissions in Crowdin please make
> sure that you have a history of contributing translations to the GitLab
> project.

1. Contribute translations to GitLab. See instructions for
   [translating GitLab](translation.md).

    Translating GitLab is a community effort that requires team work and
    attention to detail. Proofreaders play an important role helping new
    contributors, and ensuring the consistency and quality of translations.
    Your conduct and contributions as a translator should reflect this before
    requesting to be a proofreader.

1. Request proofreader permissions by opening a merge request to add yourself
   to the list of proofreaders.

    Open the [proofreader.md source file][proofreader-src] and click **Edit**.

    Add your language in alphabetical order, and add yourself to the list
    including:

    - name
    - link to your GitLab profile
    - link to your CrowdIn profile

    In the merge request description, please include links to any projects you
    have previously translated.

1. Your request to become a proofreader will be considered on the merits of
   your previous translations.
