# GitLab Helm Chart
> **Note:** This chart is currently in alpha.

The cloud native `gitlab` chart is the next generation Helm chart, currently in alpha, and will replace the [`gitlab-omnibus`](gitlab_omnibus.md) chart. It will support large deployments with horizontal scaling of individual GitLab components.

Installation instructions and known issues during alpha are available at the [project page](https://gitlab.com/charts/gitlab/).
