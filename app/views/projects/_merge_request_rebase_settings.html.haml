    %span.descr
      A merge commit is created for every merge, but merging is only allowed if fast-forward merge is possible.
      This way you could make sure that if this merge request would build, after merging to target branch it would also build.
    %br
    %span.descr
      When fast-forward merge is not possible, the user is given the option to rebase.
