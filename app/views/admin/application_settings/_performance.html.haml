            By default, we write to the "authorized_keys" file to support Git
            over SSH without additional configuration. GitLab can be optimized
            to authenticate SSH keys via the database file. Only uncheck this
            if you have configured your OpenSSH server to use the
            AuthorizedKeysCommand. Click on the help icon for more details.
